                                <li>Anatomy dependent, must be space behind for the earring to sit flush to the skin and
                                    ridge must be wide enough to hold an earring.</li>

                                <li>Anatomy dependent, must be space behind for the earring to sit flush to the skin and
                                    ridge must be wide enough to hold an earring.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Anatomy dependent, must be space behind for the earring to sit flush to the skin and
                                    ridge must be wide enough to hold an earring. The part of the upper ear that would
                                    be behind the bar also must be flat enough as to not disturb or push on the bar.
                                    This provides room for cleaning, making sure the piercing does not migrate, and
                                    ensuring that the jewelry does not cut into the flat of the ear.&nbsp;</li>

                                <li>Rare cases may not allow for the piercing, as it needs a flat surface, but it is
                                    very uncommon to not have the anatomy for a conch piercing. Some people also may
                                    have scar tissue from ears being pinned back that could cause extended healing time,
                                    but this would generally not be considered anatomy dependent.</li>

                                <li>Anatomy dependent, must have the cartilage sticking out prominently enough to pierce
                                    through with space on either side for the jewelry to sit flush.&nbsp;</li>

                                <li>Rare cases may not allow for the piercing, as it needs a semi-flat or open space,
                                    but it is very uncommon to not have the anatomy for a helix piercing. Some ears
                                    naturally do not have space and fold tightly in on themselves but this would
                                    generally not be considered anatomy dependent.</li>

                                <li>Slightly anatomy dependent, must have enough space where the ridge of the ear is
                                    flat to properly hold an earring.</li>
