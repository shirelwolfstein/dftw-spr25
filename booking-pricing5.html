                    <h2>Ear</h2>
                    <li>Forward helix
                        <ul>
                            <li>Time- precise and slower piercing so that the needle doesn&rsquo;t puncture the
                                cartilage behind the forward helix. Relative medium due to mapping and angle, but no
                                symmetry.</li>
                            <li>Difficult area to reach, but due to the straight angle of piercing it isn&rsquo;t
                                terribly difficult. Delicate process requiring specific cut receiving tube.</li>
                            <li>Symmetry- none, typically done on one ear</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Daith
                        <ul>
                            <li>Time- precise and slightly slower piercing due to crowded area that may result in lower
                                visibility. Relative medium because it usually does not require mapping for additional
                                piercings and usually no symmetry, but the angle is often tricky.</li>
                            <li>Difficulty- the angle of the piercing is hard to get to between folds, and the piercing
                                requires a curved needle for proper placement and piercing transfer.</li>
                            <li>symmetry- none, typically done on one ear</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Time- marking may take longer due to the angle being slightly variable depending on the
                                ear and client preference, two puncture holes take a bit longer. These are not difficult
                                to reach, so it is relatively quick.</li>
                            <li>Difficulty- requires proper angling and using two needles can at times be awkward, but
                                it is in an easily accessible part of the ear.</li>
                            <li>Symmetry- none, typically done on one ear</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Time- lacks complex mapping in most cases, no symmetry. Quick.</li>
                            <li>Difficulty- Relatively open area, fairly easy. Jewelry insert can sometimes be difficult
                                but not notably so.</li>
                            <li>Symmetry- none, typically done on one ear</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Time- figuring out if anatomy allows for the piercing often takes the most time, making
                                sure that there is proper space and would not be creating two separate piercings.

        <!--there will be a link to a google form for booking but it
            can be input as one of the pages and there just be an anchorpoint
            here. This wouldnt actually be an external but an INTERNAL link
            so the line wont be set up this way, I am just keeping as a placeholder.
            this will look like a complete button I think bc otherwise 
            it may not be clockable-->
