                        <li>Although this can be healed with a curved barbell, people should be aware that it is best to
                            heal with a ring since curved bars run the risk of flipping and making the angle of the
                            piercing canal heal so that nothing sits flush. Less visible often times too.</li>

                            either side of the tongue. Venom piercing is the safe alternative to frog eyes piercing.

                            choice for the piercing but still ties the different tongue muscles together and doesn't
                            allow for the natural elastic movement of the tongue.&nbsp;</li>

                        <li>Can be safely done on either side of the tongue as well, at times multiple pairs depending
                            on the length of the tongue. Double tongue piercing side to side refers to venom

                <li>Number of puncture holes- 1</li>
                <li>This piercing is popular but not advisable, considered unsafe. This ties the different tongue
                    muscles together and doesn't allow for the natural elastic movement of the tongue. The placement
                    also allows the metal of the jewelry to constantly hit the back of the client&rsquo;s teeth and
                    gums, causing nerve damage, gum recession, enamel damage, etc. May cause a lisp. Not only not
                    advisable but piercers who still offer the piercing at all are generally considered dangerous and
                    not credible due to how dangerous it is.</li>
