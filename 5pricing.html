            <h3 class="name">Forward Helix</h3>
            <ul class="info">
                <li>Time- precise and slower piercing so that the needle doesn&rsquo;t puncture the
                    cartilage behind the forward helix. Relative medium due to mapping and angle, but no
                    symmetry.</li>
                <li>Difficult area to reach, but due to the straight angle of piercing it isn&rsquo;t
                    terribly difficult. Delicate process requiring specific cut receiving tube.</li>
                <li>Symmetry- none, typically done on one ear</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <h3 class="name">Daith</h3>
            <ul class="info">
                <li>Time- precise and slightly slower piercing due to crowded area that may result in lower
                    visibility. Relative medium because it usually does not require mapping for additional
                    piercings and usually no symmetry, but the angle is often tricky.</li>
                <li>Difficulty- the angle of the piercing is hard to get to between folds, and the piercing
                    requires a curved needle for proper placement and piercing transfer.</li>
                <li>symmetry- none, typically done on one ear</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <h3 class="name">Industrial</h3>
            <ul class="info">
                <li>Time- marking may take longer due to the angle being slightly variable depending on the
                    ear and client preference, two puncture holes take a bit longer. These are not difficult
                    to reach, so it is relatively quick.</li>
                <li>Difficulty- requires proper angling and using two needles can at times be awkward, but
                    it is in an easily accessible part of the ear.</li>
                <li>Symmetry- none, typically done on one ear</li>

                <li>Time- lacks complex mapping in most cases, no symmetry. Quick.</li>
                <li>Difficulty- Relatively open area, fairly easy. Jewelry insert can sometimes be difficult
                    but not notably so.</li>

            <h3 class="name">Snug</h3>
            <ul class="info">
                <li>Time- figuring out if anatomy allows for the piercing often takes the most time, making
                    sure that there is proper space and would not be creating two separate piercings.

                <li>Not a difficult area to reach, but due to the straight angle of piercing, getting the

                <li>This piercing is popular but not advisable, considered unsafe. The venom piercing
                    allows for much better movement of the tongue and healing, the frog eyes staple bar
                    jewelry is best choice for the piercing but still ties the different tongue muscles

                    done on either side of the tongue as well, at times multiple pairs depending on the

                    the back of the client&rsquo;s teeth and gums, causing nerve damage, gum recession,
                    enamel damage, etc. May cause a lisp. Not only not advisable but piercers who still
                    offer the piercing at all are generally considered dangerous and not credible due to
