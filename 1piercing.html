        <p>Needles are NOT reusable, and a hollow bladed needle is the best for minimizing trauma to the body.
            Piercing guns force through the skin and cartilage; and they can shatter the area resulting in various
            healing processes,
            though they are often extended and grueling if not causing additional health issues that must be addressed
            by a medical professional. </p>
