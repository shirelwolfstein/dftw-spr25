make a stylesheet with the global things of your website
images of the logos on homepage and touch target
images of the page headers
search bar
h2- grenze gotisch
body- baskersville lc
images of the piercings
tags to other pages, possibly color coded links
footer, doesn't need to be interactive per se but formatted. flex box



stylesheet should be things that will be true on everything so fonts, accent color, white text, black bg
specifics later, but I don't think that I have anything 

<!-- info group component, hrh -->
<!-- body text typography -->
font-size: 16px;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: 400;
line-height: normal;
<!-- name text typography -->
font-size: 26px;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: 400;
line-height: normal;
<!-- image sizing -->
width: 119.575px;
height: 148.81px;
flex-shrink: 0;


.class of full width, then ou get to ask behind. Ignore the margnins and get rid of pading.

<!-- h2 typography -->
width: 393px;
height: 4688px;
<!-- this is from the ear on the info page after being resized. -->

<!-- all the pager headers are layered images. I can go back into ibisX and  -->
<!-- format them there so itll just be one image. -->
